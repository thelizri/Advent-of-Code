# Advent-of-Code

# 2020
2020 is being done in C. It's been a while since I programmed in C. Should be fun.

# 2021
2021 is being done in Python. It's my first time programming in python. I'm using Advent of Code to get familiar with the language. So far, I really miss the way Elixir deals with higher order functions. 

# 2022
2022 is being done in Elixir. First time programming in Elixir. Using Advent of Code to get better at the language. Many of my solutions for 2022 are really badly written. 
Especially the first few day, when I had no idea what I was doing in Elixir.
